# Quantum Circuit Simulator: NOT, SWAP & CNOT

A beginner-level quantum circuit project using Qiskit.  
This project demonstrates a 2-qubit quantum circuit with NOT, SWAP, and CNOT gates, including measurement. Even without simulation, it shows the structure and logic of the circuit.

---

## Objectives

- Combine basic quantum gates (NOT, SWAP, CNOT) in a single circuit
- Visualize the circuit both textually and graphically
- Explain the expected measurement results
- Document and share the learning process

---

## Circuit Description

The circuit has 2 qubits:

1. **NOT (X) gate** on qubit 0  
2. **SWAP gate** between qubit 0 and qubit 1  
3. **CNOT gate** (control: qubit 0, target: qubit 1)  
4. **Measurement** of both qubits  

**Expected output:** `|0⟩|1⟩`

## Code Example

```python
from qiskit import QuantumCircuit
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Create a 2-qubit quantum circuit
qc = QuantumCircuit(2)

# Apply NOT gate on qubit 0
qc.x(0)

# Apply SWAP gate between qubits 0 and 1
qc.swap(0, 1)

# Apply CNOT gate: qubit 0 as control, qubit 1 as target
qc.cx(0, 1)

# Measure both qubits
qc.measure_all()

# Display the circuit graphically
qc.draw(output='mpl')
plt.show()

# Display the circuit in text form
print(qc.draw(output='text'))

# The expected output is |0⟩|1⟩

## Expected Results

Since we are not running a simulator, the expected measurement result is:

```
|0⟩|1⟩
```
